In this repository you will find the progress ive made thus far in the completion of my portfolio website!
I've set up the necessary files and completed the basic structure for my html as well as defined some variables for the styling in my _vars.scss file. 
From here I will refine and add to the existing shell that is currently my site, and continue to sort the styling into it's respected _*.scss files before compiling them into the main sass file.
